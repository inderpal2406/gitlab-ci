# fail-safe job
# We'll check gitlab response on failure of jobs.
# We'll check if a particular job fails in a stage, what will happen to other jobs in next stage.
# We'll define 2 stages: build and test
# build stage will be assigned 2 jobs. One amongst those jobs will fail and the other will pass.
# test stage job will pass.
# We'll check if pipeline proceeds to test stage jobs.

stages:
  - build
  - test

pass_build_job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "This job will pass."
    - echo "This job is in build stage."

fail_build_job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "This job will fail."
    - echo "This job is in build stage."
    - exit 1

test_job:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "This job will pass."
    - echo "This job is in test stage."

# so, the failed job didn't allow the pipeline to proceed to next stage job.
