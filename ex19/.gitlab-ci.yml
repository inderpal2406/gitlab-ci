# ex 19
# fail-safe job
# We'll define 4 stages - build, test, deploy, clean
# Here, test stage job will be made to fail
# The pipeline should not proceed

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy
  - clean

build_job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "Build stage job."

test_job:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "Test stage job which will fail."
    - exit 1

deploy_job:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Deploy stage job."

clean_job:
  stage: clean
  script:
    - echo "Clean stage job."


# So, the 2nd job failed and the pipeline didn't proceed further.
# Gitlab provides "Play all manual" jobs option with a play icon right to the stage name using which we can play all manual jobs.
