# retry job
# We'll define 4 stages - build, test, deploy, clean
# Here, test stage job will be made to fail
# But we'll add "allow_failure" as true in test_job.
# The pipeline will proceed even if test_job fails.
# But we'll add retry attribute as 1 in test_job
# So, gitlab should retry it once on failure and then proceed (as it is also allow_failure: true)
